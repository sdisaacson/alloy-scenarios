<h1> Grafana Alloy Scenarios </h1>
</div>

This repository contains scenarios that demonstrate how to use Grafana Alloy to monitor various data sources. Each scenario is a self-contained example which will include an `LGMT` stack (Loki, Grafana, Metrics, Tempo) and an Alloy configuration file.

## Running Scenarios

You can run any scenario in two ways:

1. **Traditional way**: Navigate to the scenario directory and run `docker compose up -d`
2. **Using centralized image management**: Run `./run-example.sh <scenario-directory>` from the root directory

The centralized approach allows you to manage all Docker image versions in a single `image-versions.env` file, making it easier to update images across all examples.

## Current Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
| -------- | ------------ |
| [Docker Monitoring](docker-monitoring/) | Monitor Docker containers using Grafana Alloy. |
| [Syslog](syslog/) | Monitor non RFC5424 compliant syslog messages using rsyslog and Alloy. |
| [Logs Over TCP](logs-tcp/) | Send TCP logs to Alloy within a JSON format. |
| [Mail House](mail-house/) | Learn how to parse structured logs into Labels and Structured Metadata |
| [Monitor Windows](windows/) | Learn how to use Grafana Alloy to monitor system metrics and Event Logs|
| [Monitor Linux](linux/) | Learn how to use Grafana Alloy to monitor a Linux Server|
| [Kubernetes](k8s/) | A series of scenarios that demonstrate how to setup Alloy via the Kubernetes monitoring helm chart. Examples specific to each telemetry source are provided in the respective directories. |
| [Logs from File](logs-file/) | Monitor logs from a file using Grafana Alloy. |
| [OpenTelemetry Basic Tracing](otel-basic-tracing/) | Collect and visualize OpenTelemetry traces using Grafana Alloy and Tempo. |
